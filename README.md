# 🏥 Clinic Data Analysis & Forecasting

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes a clinic's data from multiple CSV files (Appointments, Doctors, Expenses, Patients, Revenues).  
It includes **data cleaning, merging, analysis, visualization, forecasting**, and **patient segmentation**.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Appointments.csv** → Appointment details (date, status, specialty, doctor, patient).
- **Doctors.csv** → Doctor information (ID, name, specialty).
- **Expenses.csv** → Expenses (type, year, month, day).
- **Patients.csv** → Patient details (ID, name, age, city).
- **Revenues.csv** → Revenue records (date, amount).

---

## 🔍 Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove empty rows & duplicates.
   - Standardize text (strip spaces, title case).
   - Convert date columns to `datetime`.

2. **Data Merging**
   - Merge datasets using `left join` to keep all appointments.
   - Create full date column in expenses from year/month/day.

3. **Analysis**
   - Visits per specialty, doctor, patient.
   - Age group distribution.
   - Average revenue by specialty & month.
   - Top cities by patient count.

4. **Visualization**
   - Bar charts for visits, revenues, cities.
   - Scatter plot for age vs. revenue.
   - Time series for visits & revenues.

5. **Forecasting**
   - Predict future revenue (30 days) using **Linear Regression**.

6. **Clustering**
   - Segment patients using **KMeans** based on age, city, and visit count.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified most visited specialties and top-performing doctors.
- Found revenue trends by month and specialty.
- Discovered patient distribution by city and age.
- Built a simple revenue forecast model.
- Grouped patients into behavior-based clusters.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** (LinearRegression, KMeans)
- **LabelEncoder**, **StandardScaler**

---

## 📈 Example Visuals
- Visits per specialty  
- Revenue trends over time  
- Patient age group distribution  
- Forecasted future revenues  
- Patient clusters visualization  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Use advanced forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet).
- Add more patient behavior features.
- Improve cluster selection with Elbow Method.
